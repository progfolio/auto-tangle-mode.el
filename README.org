* Auto Tangle Mode

A simple minor mode which automatically tangles literate Org mode files on save.
By default it will only tangle if point is in an org-src buffer or within a source block.
It offers the following customization variables:

- auto-tangle-predicates ::
  List of predicates checked before tangling.
  Any predicate returning a nil value prevents tangling and running hooks.

- auto-tangle-after-tangle-hook ::
  Hooks run after tangling.

- auto-tangle-before-tangle-hook ::
  Hooks run before tangling.
